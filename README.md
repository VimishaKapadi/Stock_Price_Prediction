# Stock_Price_Prediction

In this project, we forecast current market trends and predict stock prices accurately. We use various Support Vector regressions, Random forests, K-Nearest neighbors, and long short-term memory for time series forecasting. Using comparative analysis based on Root Mean Square, Mean Square, and Mean Absolute error

In this project, we predict the stock price of Tata Motors. Expecting stock market returns is challenging due to consistently changing stock values dependent on multiple parameters that form complex patterns. The dataset consists of features like high, low, open, close, adjacent close value of stock prices, and volume. Based on the understanding of traditional time series analysis and Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm, Random Forest (RF) algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network algorithm. We use comparative analysis based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). based on this we achieved above 95% accuracy for these datasets.
